# AlgoDistinctSolutions

The scope of this repository is to show how well do code embeddings behave in the task of determining the distinct solutions of a competitive programming problem.

To do that a manual dataset was annotated for 10 problems in which the number of distinct solutions is known.

The following methods to generate code embeddings were used for the above problem:
- Word2Vec
- SAFE
- Tf-idf

The preprocessing of the dataset as well as the generation of Word2vec and SAFE embeddings was done through the AlgoLabel repository. This repository has a pipeline in which those can be generated.

## How to obtain the embeddings for a raw dataset


Tell about cppchecker, g++, download safe model, create embeddings folder for w2v(modify gitignore as well)
